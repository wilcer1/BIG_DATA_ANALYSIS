# Big Data Analysis 
This is our project for the big data analysis course.<br />
Creators: Wille Cervin, Lucas Carlsson, Victor Hyl√©n, Timmy Bergvall
## Run Instructions
You need to pip install the pipinstall.txt and have the dataset in the hadoop path specified in shell_copy.py to be able to run the code. Then you can run it through terminal with "python login.py"
## File Structure
We have three main files: shell, login, and shell_copy
### Shell
Shell is encrypted python shell application that can be used to read, operate and analyse the dataset we have used. To use it, read Login.
### Login
Login is the file that handles the security of our project. If you correctly log in, the Shell program will be decrypted and you can use it. When you exit/log out, it will be encrypted again.
### Shell_copy
shell_copy was made so that our teacher can see the code and grade us.
### IMG directory
The img directory contains folders with all of our plots we have made from the dataset.
